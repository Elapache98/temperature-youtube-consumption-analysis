        <h1 style="text-align:center">If I am happier, do I spend more time on Youtube and does happiness only come with
            Manchester United winning games?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left">It is my hypothesis that the circles which are green will typically
            be the highest type of circles on the y axis because I believe the happier I am, the more Youtube videos I
            consume which
            means more minutes spent on Youtube. By tracking my daily mood and how many minutes I spent on Youtube on
            that same day I can start to see if my hypothesis is conclusive or inconclusive based off of patterns,
            correlations and trends discovered once more data is collected.</p>

        <p>I will also be tracking the days when
            Manchester United plays to see how their performance in games have subsequent effects on my mood or Youtube
            habits. </p>

        <p>I decided that the minutes I spend on Youtube shoud be on the Y-axis as it provides more longitudinal space
            to depict the potential disparity on minutes spent on Youtube between days I consider myself happy or sad. I
            chose the x-axis for my mood scale to show clusters of similar moods and see how the 3 different phases of
            my mood scale shows different habits of Youtube consumption within each mood range.</p>
        <p>So far, I wouldn't say it's inconclusive that when I'm happier I spend more time on Youtube as my second
            highest daily minutes spent on Youtube withdata so far is on a day my mood is "average". What I would
            say is conclusive is that Manchester United winning games definatley has a profound effect on my mood but
            not all the time as 50% of the time I was happy Manchester United either didn't win or play that day. </p>
        <p>I still think my original hypothesis can be true and be validated given a larger sample size. It is getting
            warmer so maybe I might spend more free time outside instead of indoors. This might affect my orignial
            hypothesis. So maybe another thing I could add is the temperature of the day because that might affect my
            mood but also the amount of time I may spend inside which will directly correlate to less time being spent
            on Youtube regardless of my mood!</p>
